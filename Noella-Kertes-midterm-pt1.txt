10. Why do we use media queries?

Media queries allow for the delivery of a tailored style to desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile devices.


11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?

Sans-serif means without serif -- they have no decorative flourish -- and as a result have a cleaner look.
